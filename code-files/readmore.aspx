    India is today home to 100 million senior citizens. The pity is that today’s rapid urbanization has overtaken the traditional value-system of our people and shifted their socio-economic priorities. Sons and daughters and their children find no time for the senior citizens in their family. The elderly, who have provided their services and support to the society, feel unloved and neglected at this phase of their lives. Their deteriorating physical strength and other geriatric illnesses add to their difficulties. Their often poor financial condition, lack of affordable health care and the general neglect by society has propelled HelpAge India to step in and bring in elder welfare programs and advocate for elder friendly policies over 36 years.

Established in 1978, Hope Center India is a leading charity platform in India working with and for disadvantaged elderly and has 
become the representative voice for India’s elderly. Dedicated to improving the status for India’s senior citizens, it works in 23 
states providing medical services, poverty alleviation and income generation schemes in urban and rural India. It welcomes all those
 who wish to support, donate or sponsor online and those who want to volunteer to help.It slowly spread its wings and started focusing on long term sustainability options for these elders through various livelihood projects and helping them form Elder Self-Help Groups, which today span India.</p>
